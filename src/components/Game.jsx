              The goal is to have more in your wallet than the other team by the
              end of the game. Small battles and attacks gives your team the
              opportunity to challenge the others and steal from them.

              The winner gets the right over both wallets. We will not only
              focus on buying NFTs but also on crypto currencies and metaverse
              land. Share your best alpha with your tribe, strategize and raise
              the value of your token. Let the battle begin!
